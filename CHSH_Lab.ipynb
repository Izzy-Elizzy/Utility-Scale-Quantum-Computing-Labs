    "Imagine a game with two players, Alice and Bob, who are spatially separated and cannot communicate once the game begins. A referee provides Alice with a random question 'X' (either 0 or 1) and Bob with a random question 'Y' (either 0 or 1). Based on their questions, Alice must produce an answer 'A' (either 0 or 1) and Bob must produce an answer 'B' (either 0 or 1).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To truly appreciate the quantum advantage, let's simulate a simple **classical strategy** and compare its performance to the quantum strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Classical Strategy:**  Alice and Bob decide on a strategy beforehand:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task (Challenge 1):** Modify the code below to simulate this classical \"Always 0\" strategy for the CHSH game.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to create a new function, for example, `classical_chsh_strategy(x, y)`, that *does not* use quantum circuits.  Instead, it should directly return Alice's answer (A=0) and Bob's answer (B=0) for any inputs x and y. Then, simulate the CHSH game using this classical strategy and calculate its average winning probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* You won't need to use Qiskit for the classical strategy simulation. You can directly calculate wins and losses based on the rules and the fixed answers A=0 and B=0.\n",
    "\n",
    "*After implementing the classical strategy simulation, compare its average winning probability to the ~85% you obtained with the quantum strategy.  You should see that the classical strategy's winning probability is indeed limited to 75% or less.*"
